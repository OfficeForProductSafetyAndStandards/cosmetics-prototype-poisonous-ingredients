          How to prepare images for notification
      </h1>

      <p>
        As part of your product notification upload the original label artwork â€“ the artwork used when the product was first placed on the market.
      </p>

     <p>
       To help National Poison Information Services identify the product upload a photo of the product and its packaging.
     </p>

     <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-1'>
       You can upload up to 10 images. Files can be up to 30MB:
     </p>
     <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
      <li>JPG</li>
      <li>PDF</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
     </ul>

    <p>
      The image must be in focus and all packaging text legible.
    </p>

    <p>
      What the image shows differs depending on the type of cosmetic product and how its packaged.
    </p>
